# Create a Tell Me About Yourself
Make a list of all the points you could include in your TMAY.
Don’t filter yet! Make a note of everything that could be relevant, for example

1. Work experience
2. Further education
3. Projects
4. Certifications
1. Bootcamps and Courses
1. Significant Achievements
1. Hobbies and Interests
1. Strengths and Skills
1. Career aspirations
1. Motivations

Pick the most relevant and impactful points from your list to put in the following categories:

- Past: Where have you come from? (~ 2 - 3 points)
- Present: Who are you now? (~ 3 - 4 points)
- Future: Where are you going? (~ 1 - 2 points)

TIP: You don’t have to include everything! Just the headlines. You’ll have a whole interview to communicate the rest.

Practice your TMAY with friends, family, colleagues, etc. Get a range of feedback, weigh it yourself, and refine as you go. From now on, you might get asked TMAY by anyone at any time!

- DO NOT write a script and try to memorise it
- You want it to flow naturally in conversation – writing is more likely to sound forced or constructed
- You might want to change the points or order when you deliver
- You might spontaneously add or remove parts – how does that affect its effectiveness?
- It’s good to get used to talking about yourself positively!

Don't have to mention everything you've done, just some of it

## Tell Me About Yourself

I graduated from Southampton Uni with an MEng in Comp Sci, then spent 5 years as a postgrad researching ML text-to-speech.

Chose to leave academia; years working on something with a tiny impact in research, v hours writing a script that instantly affects sometimes thousands of people

After that I wanted to diversify. A lot of research work required automating data handling, moving stuff across servers, etc - so DevOps seemed like a good option

In my free time: Archery coaching, amateur theatre. Maybe also writing music, brewing, dnd & ttrpgs, making games, boardgames, making stupid side-projects

in a few years: I wouldn't say I have a plan, but I'd like to be in a position to (in a proffessional sense) be able to potentially mentor newer/ junior team members beause I really like teaching. Why? The feeling of guiding someone from complete novice to compenent is simialr to the satisfaction of fixing software issues, but better?

and also to be in a place to put down roots in the community
 - problem with this is "moving around a lot" can seem dosdgy. Also, just not super useful.
