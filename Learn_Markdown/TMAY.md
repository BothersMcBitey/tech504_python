# Create a Tell Me About Yourself
Make a list of all the points you could include in your TMAY.
Don’t filter yet! Make a note of everything that could be relevant, for example

1. Work experience
2. Further education
3. Projects
4. Certifications
1. Bootcamps and Courses
1. Significant Achievements
1. Hobbies and Interests
1. Strengths and Skills
1. Career aspirations
1. Motivations

Pick the most relevant and impactful points from your list to put in the following categories:

- Past: Where have you come from? (~ 2 - 3 points)
- Present: Who are you now? (~ 3 - 4 points)
- Future: Where are you going? (~ 1 - 2 points)

TIP: You don’t have to include everything! Just the headlines. You’ll have a whole interview to communicate the rest.

Practice your TMAY with friends, family, colleagues, etc. Get a range of feedback, weigh it yourself, and refine as you go. From now on, you might get asked TMAY by anyone at any time!

- DO NOT write a script and try to memorise it
- You want it to flow naturally in conversation – writing is more likely to sound forced or constructed
- You might want to change the points or order when you deliver
- You might spontaneously add or remove parts – how does that affect its effectiveness?
- It’s good to get used to talking about yourself positively!
